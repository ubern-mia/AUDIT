    AUDIT, Analysis & evalUation Dashboard of artIficial inTelligence, is a tool designed to provide
    researcher and developers an interactive way to better analyze and explore brain MRI datasets and models.
    Given its functionalities to extract the most relevant features and metrics from your several data sources, it
    allows for uncovering biases both intra and inter-dataset as well as within the model predictions. Some of the main
    capabilities of AUDIT are presented below:""")

    st.markdown("""
        - **Data management**: Easily work and preprocess MRIs from various sources.
        - **Feature extraction**: Extract relevant features from the images and their segmentations for analysis.
        - **Model robustness**: Assess the robustness of the model by evaluating its performance across experiments
                                and conditions.
        - **Bias detection**: Identify potential biases either in model predictions and performance or on your data.
        - **Longitudinal analysis**: Track the model performance over different time points.

        - **Home Page**: The main landing page of the tool.
        - **Univariate Analysis**: Exploration of individual variables to understand their distributions and discover
                                    outliers in it.
        - **Multivariate Analysis**: Examination of multiple variables simultaneously to explore relationships and
                                     hidden patterns.
        - **Segmentation Error Matrix**: A pseudo-confusion matrix displaying the errors associated with the
                                         segmentation tasks.
        - **Model Performance Analysis**: Evaluation of the effectiveness and accuracy of a single model.
        - **Pairwise Model Performance Comparison**: Perform pair-wise comparisons between models to find statistical
                                                     significant differences.
        - **Multi-model Performance Comparison**: Comparative analysis of performance metrics across multiple models.
        - **Longitudinal Measurements**: Analysis of data collected over time to observe trends and changes on model
                                         accuracy.
        - **Subjects Exploration**: Detailed examination of individual subjects within the dataset.
